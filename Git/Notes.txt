Git Can:

get help!
	git help //insert what you want help with, or nothing! for all help//

Add repositories
	cd //go to the directory//
	git add . //dot adds all in the file// 
		OR git commit -a
	git commit -m "//add in comment here for the commit//"

See changes in repositories
	git status

see differences by comparison
	git diff

Has 3 dif stages
	1. working files
	2. staging
		git add .
	3. commit
		git commit -a -m //-a bypasses the add, and -m adds a comment//


can remove files
	git rm "//file name here//"

can restore files
	git restore "//file name here//"


can change file names
	git mv "//original file name here//" "//new file name here//"
	git commit -m "//add comment here//"

see all commits made
	git log //abreviated//
	OR
	git log -p //more detail//
	

create branches to make safe changes
	git branch //branch name// (we will call it FixTemp) //this makes new branch//
	git branch //this shows what branch we are in with an asterix//
	git switch FixTemp //now we are working in this branch//
	//now, when you make changes while in FixTemp, file explorerer will only only show FixTemp until you switch back to the main branch in Git//

Merge branches
	git switch main //switch back to branch you want to merge into//
	git merge -m "Merge fixtemp back to main //this is the message//" FixtTemp 

delete branch
	git brach -d //branch name you wish to delete//
